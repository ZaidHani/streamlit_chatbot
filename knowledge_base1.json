    },
    {
      "question": "Analytics",
      "answer": "Most likely, your credit card company sent you year-end statement with all your transactions for the entire year. What if you dug into it to see what % you spent on food, clothing, entertainment etc? You are doing \u2018analytics\u2019. You are drawing insights from your raw data which can help you make decisions regarding spending for the upcoming year. What if you did the same exercise on tweets or facebook posts made by your friends/network or your own your company. Now we are talking Big Data analytics. It is about making inferences and story-telling with large sets of data.There are 3 or 4 different types of analytics depending on who you talk to."
    },
    {
      "question": "Descriptive Analytics",
      "answer": "\u00a0If you just told me that you spent 25% on food, 35% on clothing, 20% on entertainment and the rest on miscellaneous items last year using your credit card, that is descriptive analytics. Of course, you can go into lot more detail as well."
    },
    {
      "question": "Predictive Analytics",
      "answer": "If you analyzed your credit card history for the past 5 years and the split is somewhat consistent, you can safely forecast with high probability that next year will be similar to past years. The fine print here is that this is not about \u2018predicting the future\u2019 rather \u2018forecasting with probabilities\u2019 of what might happen. In Big data predictive analytics, data scientists may use advanced techniques like data mining, machine learning, and advanced statistical processes (we\u2019ll discuss all these terms later) to forecast weather, economy etc."
    },
    {
      "question": "Prescriptive Analytics",
      "answer": "Still using the credit card transactions example, you may want to find out which spending to target (i.e. food, entertainment, clothing etc.) to make a huge impact on your overall spending. Prescriptive analytics builds on predictive analytics by including \u2018actions\u2019 (i.e. reduce food or clothing or entertainment) and analyzing the resulting outcomes to \u2018prescribe\u2019 the best category to target to reduce your overall spend. You can extend this to big data and imagine how executives can make data-driven decisions by looking at the impacts of various actions in front of them."
    },
    {
      "question": "Batch processing",
      "answer": "Even though Batch data processing has been around since mainframe days, Batch processing gained additional significance with Big Data given the large datasets that it deals with.

      "question": "Cluster computing",
      "answer": "It\u2019s a fancy term for computing using a \u2018cluster\u2019 of pooled resources of multiple servers. Getting more technical, we might be talking about nodes, cluster management layer, load balancing, and parallel processing etc."
    },
    {
      "question": "Dark Data",
      "answer": "This, in my opinion, is coined to scare the living daylights out of senior management. Basically, this refers to all the data that is gathered and processed by enterprises not used for any meaningful purposes and hence it is \u2018dark and may never be analyzed. It could be social network feeds, call center logs, meeting notes and what have you. There are many estimates that anywhere from 60-90% of all enterprise data may be \u2018dark data\u2019 but who really knows."
    },
    {
      "question": "Data lake",
      "answer": "When I first heard of this, I really thought someone was pulling an April fool\u2019s joke. But it\u2019s a real term! Data lake is a large repository of enterprise-wide data in raw format. While we are here, let\u2019s talk about Data warehouse which is similar in concept that it is also a repository for enterprise-wide data but in a structured format after cleaning and integrating with other sources. Data warehouses are typically used for conventional data (but not exclusively).

      "question": "machine learning",
      "answer": "A subset of AI,\u00a0machine learning\u00a0refers to the process by which a system learns from inputted data by identifying patterns in that data, and then applying those patterns to new problems or requests. It allows data scientists to teach a computer to carry out tasks, rather than programming it to carry out each task step-by-step. It\u2019s used, for example, to learn a consumer\u2019s preferences and buying patterns to recommend products on Amazon or sift through resumes to identify the highest-potential job candidates based on key words and phrases."

    },
    {
      "question": "classification",
      "answer": "1. Classification\u00a0is an example of supervised learning in which an algorithm puts a new piece of data under a pre-existing category, based on a set of characteristics for which the category is already known. For example, it can be used to determine if a customer is likely to spend over $20 online, based on their similarity to other customers who have previously spent that amount."
    },
    {
      "question": "cross validation",
      "answer": "Cross validation\u00a0is a method to validate the stability, or accuracy, of your machine-learning model. Although there are several types of cross validation, the most basic one involves splitting your training set in two and training the algorithm on one subset before applying it the second subset. Because you know what output you should receive, you can assess a model\u2019s validity"
    },
    {
      "question": "clustering",
      "answer": "1. Clustering\u00a0is classification but without the supervised learning aspect. With clustering, the algorithm receives inputted data and finds similarities in the data itself by grouping data points together that are alike."

      "question": "analytics",
      "answer": "Most likely, your credit card company sent you year-end statement with all your transactions for the entire year. What if you dug into it to see what % you spent on food, clothing, entertainment etc? You are doing \u2018analytics\u2019. You are drawing insights from your raw data which can help you make decisions regarding spending for the upcoming year. What if you did the same exercise on tweets or facebook posts made by your friends/network or your own your company. Now we are talking Big Data analytics. It is about making inferences and story-telling with large sets of data.There are 3 or 4 different types of analytics depending on who you talk to."
    },

      "answer": "\u00a0If you just told me that you spent 25% on food, 35% on clothing, 20% on entertainment and the rest on miscellaneous items last year using your credit card, that is descriptive analytics. Of course, you can go into lot more detail as well."
    },
    {
      "question": "predictive analytics",
      "answer": "If you analyzed your credit card history for the past 5 years and the split is somewhat consistent, you can safely forecast with high probability that next year will be similar to past years. The fine print here is that this is not about \u2018predicting the future\u2019 rather \u2018forecasting with probabilities\u2019 of what might happen. In Big data predictive analytics, data scientists may use advanced techniques like data mining, machine learning, and advanced statistical processes (we\u2019ll discuss all these terms later) to forecast weather, economy etc."
    },
    {
      "question": "prescriptive analytics",
      "answer": "Still using the credit card transactions example, you may want to find out which spending to target (i.e. food, entertainment, clothing etc.) to make a huge impact on your overall spending. Prescriptive analytics builds on predictive analytics by including \u2018actions\u2019 (i.e. reduce food or clothing or entertainment) and analyzing the resulting outcomes to \u2018prescribe\u2019 the best category to target to reduce your overall spend. You can extend this to big data and imagine how executives can make data-driven decisions by looking at the impacts of various actions in front of them."

    },
    {
      "question": "dark data",
      "answer": "This, in my opinion, is coined to scare the living daylights out of senior management. Basically, this refers to all the data that is gathered and processed by enterprises not used for any meaningful purposes and hence it is \u2018dark and may never be analyzed. It could be social network feeds, call center logs, meeting notes and what have you. There are many estimates that anywhere from 60-90% of all enterprise data may be \u2018dark data\u2019 but who really knows."

      "answer": "When I first heard of this, I really thought someone was pulling an April fool\u2019s joke. But it\u2019s a real term! Data lake is a large repository of enterprise-wide data in raw format. While we are here, let\u2019s talk about Data warehouse which is similar in concept that it is also a repository for enterprise-wide data but in a structured format after cleaning and integrating with other sources. Data warehouses are typically used for conventional data (but not exclusively). Supposedly data lake makes it easy to access enterprise-wide data you really need to know what you are looking for and how to process it and make intelligent use of it."

    },
    {
      "question": "hadoop",
      "answer": "When people think of big data, they immediately think about Hadoop. Hadoop (with its cute elephant logo) is an open source software framework that consists of what is called a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and allows for storage, retrieval, and analysis of very large data sets using distributed hardware. If you really want to impress someone, talk about YARN (Yet Another Resource Scheduler) which, as the name says it, is a resource scheduler. I am really impressed by the folks who come up with these names. Apache foundation, which came up with Hadoop, is also responsible for Pig, Hive, and Spark (yup, they are all names of various software pieces). Aren\u2019t you impressed with these names?"

IOT generates huge amounts of data presenting many big data analytics opportunities."
    },
    {
      "question": "mapreduce",
      "answer": "MapReduce could be little bit confusing but let me give it a try. MapReduce is a programming model and the best way to understand this is to note that Map and Reduce are two separate items. In this, the programming model first breaks up the big data dataset into pieces (in technical terms into \u2018tuples\u2019 but let\u2019s not get too technical here) so it can be distributed across different computers in different locations (i.e. cluster computing described earlier) which is essentially the Map part. Then the model collects the results and \u2018reduces\u2019 them into one report. MapReduce\u2019s data processing model goes hand-in-hand with hadoop\u2019s distributed file system."

      "answer": "It almost sounds like a protest against \u2018SQL (Structured Query Language) which is the bread-and-butter for traditional Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) but NOSQL actually stands for Not ONLY SQL :-). NoSQL actually refers to database management systems that are designed to handle large volumes of data that does not have a structure or what\u2019s technically called a \u2018schema\u2019 (like relational databases have). NoSQL databases are often well-suited for big data systems because of their flexibility and distributed-first architecture needed for large unstructured databases."

      "answer": "The following are ways to handle missing data values:    If the data set is large, we can just simply remove the rows with missing data values. It is the quickest way; we use the rest of the data to predict the values.               For smaller data sets, we can substitute missing values with the mean or average of the rest of the data using the pandas' data frame in python.

      "answer": "Root cause analysis was initially developed to analyze industrial accidents but is now widely used in other areas. It is a problem-solving technique used for isolating the root causes of faults or problems. A factor is called a root cause if its deduction from the problem-fault-sequence averts the final undesirable event from recurring."
